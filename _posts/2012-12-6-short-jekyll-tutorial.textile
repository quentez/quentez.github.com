Jekyll is a very lightweight blogging engine that generates static HTML files from templates and markdown/textile content. It's a good alternative to complex systems like WordPress when all you need is a very simple and non-dynamic blog.

As I had to go through the process of learning Jekyll in order to setup this blog, I though I might as well write a short tutorial on how to get up to speed quickly with this blogging engine.

h3. Prerequisites

# *Environment:* You'll need to have @Ruby@ installed in order to run @Jekyll@. You can get more information about that "here":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/.
# To install Jekyll itself and its dependencies, the easiest way around is to use @Ruby GEM@ with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}

#_ If you plan on using @Textile@, you'll also need the @RedCloth@ gem.

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install redcloth
{% endhighlight %}
